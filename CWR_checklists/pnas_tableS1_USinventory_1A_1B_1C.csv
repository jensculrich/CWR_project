The pest of greatest concern is the Asian Longhorned Beetle (<em>Anoplophora glabripennis</em>) as <em>Acer saccharum </em>is one of<em>&#160;</em>the preferred hosts within North America (Dodds and Orwig<em>&#160;</em>2011). This pest has established populations across parts of the species range (Minnesota to Maine) (Townsend Peterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). This causes death to urban trees but mortality is lower in native forest (Dodds and Orwig<em>&#160;</em>2011). The current and future impact of this pest on the species is not known and should be investigated.<br/><br/>In the future the species may be threatened by climate change which may reduce the amount of suitable habitat for the species, resulting in a distribution change or potentially increased species mortality (Potter and Hargrove&#160;2013, Iverson <em>et al. </em>2008). The species is already being affected by climate change as conditions are becoming wetter which the species is less tolerant of (Bishop <em>et al. </em>2015). The species is also becoming increasing susceptible to freeze-thaw injury (Gilman and Watson&#160;1993) and also scorching. <em>Acer saccharum </em>is susceptible to fire but these have been suppressed over the last six centuries (Nesom 2006). Recently, <em>Acer saccharum</em>&#160;has been reported to be in decline over some parts of the range. The cause of which is uncertain but increased occurrence of acid rain producing unfavourable, acidic soil conditions is currently the most widely support hypothesis (Bishop <em>et al. </em>2015).

Population although currently considered stable may decline as a result of climate change. A study by Potter and Hargrove&#160;(2013) suggested a decline of 86.7% in suitable habitat area (km<sup>2</sup>) over the next 50 years based on climate modelling and emissions data. Iverson&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2008) also reported that&#160;<em>A. pensylvanicum&#160;</em>abundance could decline by 50% as a result of climate change within its US range. These changes could qualify the species as Critically Endangered under criterion A3 however we do not know the the extent to which dispersal capacity, effect of/on associated species, generation time and other ecological factors were considered when generating the models. These factors would need full consideration to accurately assess population decline; therefore true future population decline is not known.",Stable,"<em>Acer nigrum </em>is endemic to North America. In Canada the species is found in Quebec and Ontario. The species is also found in the midwestern United States; from Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri in the west through Kentucky and north to Vermont; occurring in the majority of states in between (Little 1976, USDA 2017). The species has an extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) that far exceeds the criteria for a threatened category.","<em>Acer nigrum </em>sap is widely tapped to produce syrup (Gabriel 2017). The species is also used for its timber which is in turn used to produce flooring, veneer, musical instruments, baseball bats and a variety of household items. It can also be used to produce paper (Meier 2015). The species is also planted as an ornamental.",Terrestrial,There are at least 28 <em>ex situ </em>collections of the species across the globe (BGCI 2017). The species is considered not threatened by Nature Serve (NatureServe 2009) and by Gibbs <em>et al. </em>2009. The species should be monitored to assess its response to climate change and the impact of the Asian Longhorned Beetle on the species should be investigated.,Nearctic,,,,Global,275,24,8.727272727,8.127302479,95,37.2848584,HP

The species is here assessed as Critically Endangered due to the large and rapid declines (90-99%) in population size over the last three generations (or less) due to Chestnut Blight disease. <em>Castanea dentata</em> remains under threat from this disease which continues to limit the population growth leaving sprouting from stumps as the main known individuals of the species. Major efforts are underway to conserve the species. Future research needs to establish a better understanding of the disease and potential ways to induce resistance in the population. <em>Ex situ </em>conservation will be essential in preventing this species becoming extinct.,"This tree was formerly one of the most important, largest, and most abundant forest trees in the mountains of eastern North America, found in the Eastern hardwood forest. Subpopulations are small and persist in localities through sprouting from stumps, before possibly flowering and fruiting, and then dying back again from blight. Flowering occurs between June and July. The species was previously common in rich deciduous and mixed forests, particularly with oak, but now persists in isolated and fragmented populations (eFloras 1997).","<p><em>Castanea dentata</em>&#160;has been severely affected by Chestnut Clight, a bark fungal disease that probably entered the U.S. from Japan in the late 1890s. <span lang=""EN-US"">Chestnut Blight is not just associated with shoot dieback; it kills twigs and branches of any size. It is caused by a fungus,&#160;<em>Cryphonectria parasitica&#160;</em>(=<em>Endothia parasitica</em>). <span lang=""EN-US"">By 1950, 99.9% of American Chestnuts were reduced to either dead stumps or stumps with adventitious sprouts arising from the roots surrounding them. Many of these stumps persist today and are still sending up diseased sprouts (Missouri Botanical Garden 2018).</span></p>","The known population is in decline due to Chestnut Blight. Chestnut Blight, introduced in the 1800s, reduced the population of American Chestnuts to 0.01% of its original size by 1950 (Missouri Botanical Garden 2018). The population was estimated to historically consist of 4.2 billion trees. In 2016, the estimated stems is approximately 10% of the estimated pre-blight population, however, 84% of these stems are &lt;2.5 cm dbh (Dalgleish <em>et al. </em>2015). The blight does not affect the roots of the species, so&#160;the blight did not cause the extinction of&#160;<em>C. dentata</em>, however, it did effectively extirpate the species from the canopy, causing it to be functionally extinct&#160;(Dalgleish&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). The generation length of this long lived tree is thought to be over 100 years, so the reduction has taken place in the last two generations, and it is assumed that the population was stable prior to the introduction of blight.",Decreasing,"This species is found from southern Ontario, east to Maine, south to Georgia and Florida, west to Mississippi and Louisiana, and north to Missouri and Illinois. The highest population was known in the southern Appalachian Mountains until Chestnut Blight decimated population numbers. However, distribution may have spread from pre-blight distributions, due to human location.","<p>The sweet seed of this tree can be used as food, both raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into powder and then added to cereals when making bread, cakes etc. A delicious oil can be extracted from the seed by crushing the nuts, boiling them in water and then skimming off the oil as it comes to the surface. It can be used as a topping for various puddings. The roasted nut can be used as a coffee substitute and a chocolate substitute can also be made from it (Plants for a Future 2018).<br/><br/>The bark is an exceptionally good source of tannin and the dried leaves contain 9% tannin as well as the wood and seed husks containing significant levels of tannin with the husks containing between 10â13% tannin.&#160;A brown dye can be obtained from the bark as well.<br/><br/>The wood is soft and not that strong, light, liable to warp, but very durable with it weighing approximately 28 lb per cubic foot. It is used for making cheap furniture, fence posts and for construction (Plants for a Future 2018). It was of major significance to rural economies in the past.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Chinese Chestnut has been crossed with American Chestnut to try to create a more resistant population to Chestnut Blight. They are then back crossing the American Chestnuts with aim to create a disease resistant American Chestnut hybrid, that is genetically 99% American Chestnut&#160;(Missouri Botanical Garden 2018)<span lang=""EN-US"">. There has also been attempts to control the blight with biocontrol and genetic engineering (Jacobs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Due to these efforts restoration is now underway. This species is found in 73 <em>ex situ</em> collections (BGCI 2018).

It has a wide distribution and there are no known threats. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern.,"A shrub up to 3 m tall, it is found in thickets, open woods and landscapes disturbed by fire and logging. It is moderately shade tolerant. Beaked Hazel is an early successional species but can also be found in forests that are in later stages of succession. Populations decline with the recruitment of more shade tolerant species as the canopy closes. It prefers neutral to acidic soil, wet-mesic to dry-mesic and does not grow well on fine-textured clays or wet soils such as peats.",There are no range wide threats reported for this species.,"A very common species across most of its range. However, there is no hard data on  population numbers due to it being common and not an important  commercial species.&#160;This species is listed as Globally Secure by NatureServe, however, populations in Ohio are Possible Extirpated, those in Delaware are Critically Imperiled, those in Wyoming are imperiled and those in Louisiana Newfoundland and Maryland are Vulnerable.",Stable,This species is found in Canada and the United States.,"This species is commercially grown for the edible nuts. They can be roasted, candied or added to other foods, they can also be made into oil or ground into flour. This tree is also used in wildlife habitat plantings to provide cover and nuts, which are eaten by squirrels, deer, grouse and pheasant.<br/><em><br/></em><em>C. cornuta</em> was used medicinally by Native Americans as an emetic, for teething, to expel worms, to heal cuts, and as an astringent. The wood was used to make bows, tools, fish traps and baby carriers. Young, straight suckers used to make arrows, and peeled and twisted to make ropes. The roots and inner bark produce a blue dye when steeped in water.<br/><br/>This species has limited ornamental value and cultivars apparently have not been developed.&#160;<br/><br/>This species is removed by growers of commercial, closely managed forests, primarily because of its aggressive colonial habit and corresponding competition with timber trees.",Terrestrial,<p>There are no reported conservation actions in place for this species.&#160;</p>,Nearctic,,,,Global,767,186,24.25032595,19.67070605,85.71428571,43.21177257,HP

In these regions, periods of  drought of more  than 20 months can be observed. It can grow in a range of habitats, including tropical deciduous forests, rocky lake shores, washes, stream beds and overflow channels, lava beds, roadsides, waste places, alkali plains, creosote bush scrub, saltbush scrub, grassland-saltbush scrub, annual grasslands, mezquite desert, chaparral-desert scrub and upland desert scrub (Bemis and Whitaker 1969, Lira <em>et al</em>. 2009, Nesom 2016, Calflora 2017, USDA-NRCS 2017).","An increased fire regime (associated with climate change) could possibly affect the species but this has not been studied in detail. The cultivation of genetically modified squashes (<em>Cucurbita pepo</em> Virus Resistant, or <em>C. pepo</em>VR) in Mexico is a potential threat to other wild and domesticated <em>Cucurbita </em>species due to the risk of hybridisation between these species and <em>C. pepo</em>VR in the event it  escapes its cultivation area. The risk for the members of the phylogenetic group Digitata (<em>C. digitata</em>, <em>C. cordata</em> and <em>C. palmata</em>) is, however, low. This is because there is a deficient compatibility, differences in reproductive systems and floral phenology with <em>C. pep</em>o, besides the specificity of pollination bees (Bemis and Whitaker 1969, Arriaga <em>et al</em>. 2006, Lira <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;<em></em>The intensification of pesticides and herbicides use in extensive agriculture (scale larger than 5 ha) is also a major threat to this species (R. Bye and E. Linares pers. comm. 2018).","Subpopulations of this species can be found throughout the year  within its distribution range. It is uncommon but not rare and has been ranked as Apparently Secure in the United  States of America. However, it was ranked as Critically                                    Imperiled in <span id=""lblTaxonDesc"">Utah, being at a very high risk of extinction in this state (Lira and RodrÃ­guez-ArÃ©valo 2006, NatureServe 2015).",Decreasing,"The native distribution of <em>Cucurbita palmata </em>comprises the southwestern United States of America and northern Mexico (Lira and RodrÃ­guez-ArÃ©valo 2006, Lira <em>et al</em>. 2009, USDA, ARS, GRIN 2017).

Moreover, seeds of the species in this group have high content  of oil  and protein, qualities that can be of interest in future genetic   improvement of the related crops (Bemis <em>et al</em>. 1967, <span class=""style3"">Provvidenti 1978, Lira <em>et al</em>. 2009).

As this species is thought to occur in only two localities, and such dramatic declines in subpopulations having been recorded, it is possible that these two localities are under threat and criterion D2 would then also apply. However, more information is required to confirm this.<br/><br/>Survey work should be undertaken for this species as an urgent priority to determine its extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO) and whether or not there is continuing decline in population size as, with additional data, there is potential for this species to be classified as Endangered under criterion B (number of locations less than five and likely decline in EOO, AOO and number of subpopulations) and criterion C (number of mature individuals less than 2,500 and less than or equal to 250 mature individuals in each subpopulation).<br/><br/>Considering the potential for this species to be classified as Endangered with more data available, efforts to provide active conservation both <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> are urgently required to secure this resource in the long-term. Surveys within protected areas that are thought to contain the species would also be beneficial to determine whether any parts of the species range are already receiving some level of&#160;<em>in situ</em>&#160;conservation. Investigation into the threats facing the two subpopulations would help to estimate whether there is any ongoing decline in population size and would also help to determine the rate of decline.","This xerophytic species is found in sand dunes and swales between 1,000 and 2,000 m a.s.l., on open, disturbed, field soils and under sand dune agriculture in the southern part of its range (NatureServe 2013). Nabhan (1989) identified populations of the anomalous sunflower on top of the&#160;mesas (flat topped hills or mountains, otherwise known as tableland) within the&#160;Hopi Indian Reserve, Arizona, although it is not known whether this population is introduced.","The reasons for the scarcity of this species described by Selier (2007) are unknown, although the same author notes that it had been an extremely dry year and that there was no evidence of the species being present in the fragile sandy habitat. Selier (2007) hypothesises that because several sand dune habitats had become popular off-road vehicle recreational areas, this may have posed a serious threat to the species' already fragile existence.&#160;<br/><br/>According to NatureServe (2013) more general threats to this species include the total abandonment of agricultural fields and road construction.&#160;<br/><br/>Furthermore, given this species' affiliation with arable land and the partial dependence of some populations on active conservation by members of the Hopi tribe, modernization or mechanization (in particular the use of pre-emergent herbicides or frequent, deep ploughing with tractors) of Hopi agriculture could pose a plausible threat to this species (Nabhan 1989).","In 1983 this species was known from less than 25 localities across a geographic range of&#160;46,000 km<sup>2 </sup>in Utah and Arizona&#160;(Nabhan and Reichhardt 1983). The same authors noted that five of the seven populations visited at the time had 250 individuals or less, and one was destined for destruction by road construction.&#160;<br/><br/>Since that time, a 'perplexing scarcity' of plants at all 25 previously known sites has been documented by Selier (2007) from a collecting expedition carried out in the year 2000. Only two localities, both in the northwest part of the species' range at a distance of 5 km from one another, presented achene-bearing plants (i.e. were reproducing populations); these were both small subpopulations of between 200 and 250 individuals scattered over an area of 0.2 ha (Selier 2007).",Decreasing,"NatureServe (2013) states that&#160;<em>Helianthus anomalus </em>is endemic to North America, specifically the states of Utah and northern Arizona, extending along the Colorado Plateau to the eastern Great Basin into Nevada. Contrary to other sources, New Mexico is also listed, but its presence in this state is recorded as 'Not ranked/Under Review' (NatureServe 2013).","The genus&#160;<em>Helianthus&#160;</em>attracts a large number of native bees, and so is&#160;listed in the Pollinator programme at The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation (Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center 2013).<br/><br/>This species is a secondary genetic relative of the cultivated Sunflower <em>H. annuus</em>&#160;L. (USDA, ARS National Genetic Resources Program 2013) and also belongs to Taxon Group four of the Jerusalem Artichoke <em>H.&#160;</em><em>tuberosus&#160;</em>L. (Schilling and Heiser 1981)<em>.&#160;</em>It has already been utilized for the breeding of fertility restoration genes into cultivated sunflower (Seiler 1991).&#160;<br/><br/>In addition to this, <em>H. anomalus</em> is heavily associated with native American communities where is has high cultural value due to its traditional use by the people of the Hopi Indian Reserve. For example, Voth (1903) wrote a monograph describing how the dried petals were ground up and used both as a power for decorating the faces of maidens during ceremonies and as a charm put on the boomerangs and sticks of hunters to ""cause game to walk slow"". Seeds were traditionally eaten and the plant used as stock fodder (Nabhan and Reichhardt 1983).",Terrestrial,"In 1999, NatureServe (2013) assessed this species as vulnerable (at moderate risk of extinction) across its entire range and imperilled (at high risk of extinction) in Nevada and Arizona.

Despite being listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and its reliance on a rare and threatened wetland habitat, the species was reported to be relatively stable in 1998 and active management and monitoring of this species has since been implemented thanks to the species recovery plan published in 2005 (USFWS 2005). There is evidence to suggest the provision of active <em>in situ</em> conservation is having a positive effect on population sizes and is even allowing the species to reestablish in previously lost areas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service aim to delist the species from the Endangered Species Act by 2019.<br/><br/>However, due to its reliance on cienega habitats and the various threats it faces, if there is a sudden cessation of conservation actions it could cause sudden losses of subpopulations of this species. Therefore, it is vital that the cooperative management plans that have been established as part of the species' recovery plan are upheld and continue in the long-term. Ongoing education of the public and land owners and the strengthening of state, federal and private partnerships are essential.","This annual herb can grow to 1â2 m in height and is found in wetland habitat with permanently saturated soils called cienegas (desert springs and seeps); it can also be found on margins of lakes, creeks and impoundments (USFWS 2005). Cienegas are a rare wetland habitat in the arid southwest region of the United States of America (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984) and typically have saline/alkaline soils due to the presence of water that is high in dissolved solids coupled with high evaporation rates that leave salt deposits (USFWS 2005).","The primary threat to the population of <em>H</em><em>elianthus</em><em>&#160;paradoxus</em> is the loss of wetland habitat through the lowering of ground water levels as water is diverted/extracted for agriculture and urban development purposes (USFWS 2005). Competition from exotic species is also a prominent threat to <em>H. paradoxus</em>, particularly due to the spread of salt cedar (<em>Tamarix</em> ssp.) which removes all native vegetation from wetlands that it invades and alters the habitat to become drier and more saline (NatureServe 2013). Hybridization between this species and common Sunflower has also been observed in some areas where they co-occur and this has the potential to compromise the genetic integrity of the <em>H. paradoxus</em> population (NatureServe 2005). The same source also highlights that livestock grazing and wildfires can have negative impacts on <em>H. paradoxus</em> populations, however there is evidence to suggest that some level of grazing can reduce competition and actually benefit these sunflower populations if it occurs at an appropriate stage of the plant's life cycle i.e. non-flowering months (USFWS 2005). Another threat to this species is the development of wetlands for other uses, furthermore some populations occur on private land where owners have expressed an interest in draining the wetlands on which the species occurs (NatureServe 2013). Finally, one of the sites in west Texas occurs in an oil and gas field where there is potential for contamination of the desert spring and ground water (NatureServe 2013).","According to NatureServe (2013),&#160;<em>H</em><em>elianthus</em><em>&#160;paradoxus</em>&#160;is imperilled in New Mexico and critically imperilled in&#160;Texas however, it should be noted that these statuses were last reviewed in March 2003 and since then a recovery plan has been put in place (USFWS 2005). It is known to occur in seven localities, five of which are within the state of New Mexico (two separate localities in the Pecos River Valley in eastern New Mexico, two localities on the Rio San Jose and one locality on the Rio Grande in west-central New Mexico) and two of which are located in desert springs in west Texas (USFWS 2005). The locality in Diamond Y Creek in Texas is thought to contain hundreds of thousands of individuals and the other locality, in East Sandia Springs, contains thousands of individuals (NatureServe 2013). NatureServe (2013) suggest that, during surveys carried out before 2003, only a couple of the subpopulations in New Mexico were locally abundant (with greater than 3,000 individuals) whereas many of the others were small and non-viable. Furthermore, in 1999, this species was listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (USESA). Although at the time the overall population was considered to be relatively stable it was also recognized that its long-term survival was completely dependent on the maintenance and protection of suitable habitat (NatureServe 2013). More recent anecdotal evidence suggests that the numbers of individuals and subpopulations of&#160;<em>H. paradoxus</em> may be increasing due to successful conservation activities (Zenone 2012).",Stable,"<em>Helianthus paradoxus </em>is endemic to the states of New Mexico and Texas in the United States of America, occurring at elevations between 1,000 m and 1,200 m a.s.l. (Flora of North America Editorial Committee 2006).","This species belongs to Gene Pool two of the cultivated Sunflower <em>H</em><em>elianthus</em><em>&#160;annuus</em> (USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program 2013) and Taxon Group four of the Jerusalem Artichoke <em>H. tuberosus</em>&#160;(Schilling and Heiser 1981), as a result this species has potential for use as a gene donor for crop improvement, particularly as a source of salt tolerance for sunflower&#160;(USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program 2013).<br/><br/>In addition, the genus&#160;<em>Helianthus&#160;</em>attracts large numbers of native bees and so is&#160;listed in the Pollinator programme at The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation (Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Despite the vast array of threats identified that may be affecting this species, conservation measures are in place across this species' native range. In 1999, it was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and in 2005 a species recovery plan was adopted to work towards long-term protection and management of the species so that it may be removed from the Endangered Species Act by 2019 (USFWS 2005). The recovery plan aimed to achieve this by: 1) identifying core conservation areas and isolated stands of the species, 2) identifying and filling gaps in knowledge regarding appropriate management actions based on the species' life history and habitat, 3) implementing active protection of these core conservation areas and isolated stands through landowner education, management plans and land acquisition and 4) monitoring these sunflower populations and their management in the long-term to ensure the species can be removed from the Endangered Species Act&#160;(USFWS 2005).<br/><br/>There is evidence to suggest this recovery plan is having positive results. The Nature Conservancy own both localities where this species occurs in Texas and actively manage the subpopulations through exotic species removal, rotational grazing programs and on-going hydrological research (USFWS 2005).

Despite this,&#160;<em>H. praecox</em>&#160;subsp.&#160;<em>hirtus </em>is reported to occur in 35â40 subpopulations in northwestern Dimmit County, Texas and estimates suggest that approximately 1.7 million individuals occur on public land in this area, increasing to nearly 10 million individuals when private land is taken into account (NatureServe 2013). The overall population of this subspecies is thought to be relatively stable but that some subpopulations are increasing while others are declining (NatureServe 2013). Finally,&#160;the subspecies <em>runyonii</em>&#160;is common, weedy, disturbance tolerant and secure (NatureServe 2013).",Stable,"This species and all three subspecies are endemic to the state of Texas in the United States of America (Flora of North America Editorial Committee 2006). <em>H</em><em>elianthus</em><em>&#160;praecox </em>subsp.&#160;<em>hirtus&#160;</em>occurs in the county of Dimmit, near the town of Carrizo Springs, in southern Texas, between 50 m and 100 m a.s.l., while&#160;subsp.&#160;<em>runyonii </em>and subsp. <em>praecox </em>are more widespread in southern Texas and occur at elevations from sea level to 50 m a.s.l.

USDA, Agricultural Research Service, National Plant Germplasm System (2018) also includes the state of Louisiana in USA and Tamaulipas in Mexico. In south America it is locally abundant in the lowlands of eastern Bolivia, northern Argentina and Paraguay but is very rare in Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul) (J.R.I. Wood pers. comm. 2018a).

Therefore, in total the species has living collections in seven botanic gardens worldwide, although the origin and locality of the collections are not detailed in this resource (garden locations are undisclosed to protect rare and valuable plant species).<br/><br/>It was assessed at the global scale as Not Threatened (G5) in 1993 and <em>I. cordatotriloba </em>var. <em>cordatotriloba</em> was assessed as Not Threatened (T5) in 1986 (NatureServe 2018).

It therefore has a fairly large global range but does not occupy a large area within this range<span style="""">, which means it has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 44 km<sup>2</sup>, which qualifies it as Endangered.

In addition, it is likely to be severely fragmented, and is undergoing continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat as a result of continued development and fire suppression. Furthermore, it is known to be rare throughout much of its range. It is therefore globally assessed as Endangered, meeting criteria B2ab(iii).","Originally, the species was often found in pine ro<span style="""">cklands&#160;in Florida. How</span>ever, as a result of continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, it is now often found in disturbed areas (Encyclopedia of Life 2018). It also occurs in low dry forests and plains âsabanasâ (J.R.I Wood pers. comm. 2018).",Continuing development and fire suppression are resulting in habitat decline for this species (Encyclopedia of Life 2018). It is unlikely to face any threats in its main area of occurrence (Cuba) (J.R.I. Wood pers. comm. 2018).,"The species is very rare in south Florida (Gann <em>et al. </em>2018) with only four known occurrences (NatureServe 2018). In Mona Island it is known from a single collection. In Hispaniola it is described by Liogier (1994) as âbastante frecuenteâ (very frequent) but J.R.I. Wood (pers. comm. 2018) thinks that it is likely to be rare as there are few specimens known. It is common throughout Cuba and there are 15 known collections from different parts of the island (J.R.I. Wood pers. comm. 2018). Populations are thought to be stable (J.R.I. Wood pers. comm. 2018). It is likely to be severely fragmented, with very little, if any, dispersal between Florida and Cuba subpopulations.",Stable,"<em>Ipomoea tenuissima </em>is native to Florida in south-eastern USA, as well as Cuba, Hispaniola (both Haiti and the Dominican Republic sides) and Mona Island (Puerto Rico) in the Caribbean (J.R.I.

In addition to the data points included in this calculation, it is known from five localities in Hispaniola (The New York Botanical Garden 2018), but these points do not have coordinates and therefore cannot be used in the calculation of EOO and AOO.

This accession is backed up at a second genebank, but is not duplicated and&#160;conserved in the Svalbard Seed Vault (Genesys Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources 2018). Khoury <em>et al.</em> (2015) identified that this species is poorly represented  in genebank collections and needs to be collected for <em>ex situ</em>  conservation, namely throughout its entire native range (Cuba,  Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico and USA). In addition, this species has living collections in&#160;one&#160;botanic garden worldwide, although the origin and locality of the collections are not detailed in this resource (garden locations are undisclosed to protect rare and valuable plant species) (BGCI 2018).

The species is found in the south of the state, where it is present in seven counties. The extent of occurrence of the species is 28,850&#160;km<sup>2 </sup>and area of occupancy is estimated to be around 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The population size is unknown and the species can be dominant in woodland. Despite this there is continuing decline in population size due to threats from habitat loss and conversion, grazing of the habitat and increased occurrence of fire. There are also concerns for the future regeneration of the species and potential habitat availability due to a local growing human population which could put pressure on the species and its habitat. The species is assessed as Near Threatened as it almost reaches the criteria for Vulnerable B2ab(iii) but is found in more than ten locations. More information on the current status of population size would be valuable.","<p>Southern California walnut is a shrub or small tree, growing to 6 - 15 m in height (Stone 1997). The species can form woodland where it may be monospecific or mixed, often occurring alongside <em>Quercus agrifolia</em>. The species is sometimes found in small stands in chaparral and coastal shrub. Trees generally occur on mesic sites such as north slopes, creekbeds, canyon bottoms, and alluvial terraces (Esser 1993). They grow best in deep, alluvial soils with high water-holding capacity. Walnut woodland generates important habitat for vertebrates and invertebrates especially birds. The species can resprout after fire.</p><p>This habitat type is currently in decline due to urbanisation and local grazing of the woodland.</p>","There are many threats to <em>Juglans californica</em>. Urbanisation, including the development of expressways and golf courses, leads to the clearance of large stands of the tree. These threats coupled with human population growth (could increase by roughly 50%) are the major future threats to the species (J. Keeley pers. comm. 2018). This could have a dramatic affect on the habitat available for the species in the future.&#160;Cattle grazing is another threat to the species reducing the regeneration potential for the species as young seedlings are consumed. These threats have led to Walnut woodland becoming fragmented and small (NatureServe 2018). There is also threat from more fire and competition with introduced invasive species. The species may also be at risk from climate change (Potter <em>et al. </em>2017). The species may become threatened by the fungal pathogen that causes Thousand Cankers Disease in <em>J. nigra </em>but currently <em>J. californica </em>shows resistance. Another risk is from hybridization with <em>J. hindsii </em>which has been introduced to <em>J. californica </em>range (Potter <em>et al. </em>2018).","<p></p><p>The species is most common in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. Small stands are found in the Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains, San Jose Hills, Puente Hills and Chino Hills (Esser 1993). 3,500 living individuals were recorded from Sulphur Mount, Ventura County, California making up 49% of the basal area (Keeley 1990). In the same study, 1,130 living individuals were found on Mount Washington, LA County contributing to 90% of the basal area (Keeley 1990). Finally, at Montecito heights, LA County 1,710 living individuals were counted with a basal cover of 95% (Keeley 1990). At each of these three sites, there were also 50 to 100 dead individuals of the species (Keeley 1990).&#160; Keeley (1990), also looked at the size structure of the species and most individuals had a small dbh. Based on estimates from these three sites, population size is suspected to exceed 10,000 mature individuals. Nature Serve (2018) describes the population size as 'sufficient' and widespread. It can also be dominant in woodlands (Esser 1993). A lack of natural reproduction is also reported (NatureServe 2018). Subpopulations are found in protected areas and due to the species dominance in woodland, these can be large and stable subpopulations.&#160;</p><p>Riordan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2015), looked at the possible behavior of this species and its' preferred habitat type in response to climate change. A potential 20,493 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of climatically suitable habitat was identified for the species, 31% of this habitat has already been subject to decline due to anthropogenic development of urban areas and agriculture and before 2080 a further 33% could be lost. Climate change also has the potential to cause 48 - 61% of currently suitable habitat to be lost, which alongside anthropogenic changes could see&#160;<em>J. californica&#160;</em>experience habitat loss of between 64 and 70% (worst case scenario). However, climate change may not have a negative impact and could see the range of the species expand along the coast by 218% (Riordan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). More information is needed on how the species will disperse, and reproduce alongside fine scale habitat and ecological information (soil moisture etc.) is needed before these models can better predict what will happen to the population size of the species in response to climate change.</p><p>Considering these details, overall the population is experiencing decline due to loss of habitat and grazing of the natural habitat. Californian Walnut forests are also becoming more fragmented. There has been great historical decline due to human population growth in the state and this growth is predicted to continue if not increase into the future. This will have a major impact on the population of <em>J. californica </em>oustide of protected areas, as available habitat may be significantly reduced. However in the protected sites large stable subpopulations will persist.</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to California, USA. Following NatureServe (2018), the species is only present in the counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and San Diego. There are records of the species as far north as the Santa Clara County but these specimens are likely to have been misidentified or are from planted trees.&#160;&#160;The extent of occurrence of the species is 28,850 km<sup>2</sup>.

The species is not abundant across this wide range and the population is also in rapid decline. This is caused by the invasion of the non-native, fungal pest&#160;<em>Ophiognomonia&#160;</em><em>clavigignenti-juglandacearum</em>&#160;which upon infection can kill trees. The infection can spread quickly and already the pest is found across the species range. There is limited natural resistance to this fungus which was introduced in 1967. Since this time reports of decline from different states varies from 27% to 91%. Due to this variation it is predicted that historical population decline has been up to 80%. This figure is also given to decline across a three generation shifting window and to a suspected decline, over the next 100 years. Efforts are being made to better understand ways to protect butternut from the pest. The species is currently globally assessed as Endangered.","This large tree species can grow up to 30 m in height (NatureServe 2018). The species occupies riparian sites, occurring in bottomlands and floodplains and along ravines, terraces, creeks and streams in mesophytic forest (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990). The species can produce seed from around 20 years of age, and lives around 75 years (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006). The species is often associated with <em>Acer saccharum, Tilia americana, Lirodendron tulipifera, Quercus rubra, Fagus </em>spp. and many more hardwood types (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990). The species is not abundant in its habitat, with individual butternut trees being found in mixed stands. It is a shade intolerant tree, and can reach the canopy (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990, Coladonato 1991).","The greatest threat to the species is decline due to butternut canker, caused by the pathogen&#160;<em>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>(Borders <em>et al. </em>2015). This pest can infect trees of all age and size classes (McIlwrick <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). It can infect rapidly and invade just as quickly, hence only a few uninfected stands remain (NatureServe 2018). The pest is thought to be waterbourne but may also be dispersed by insects (Borders <em>et al. </em>2015). Infection results in the premature death of the tree as the tree becomes girdled and the cambium is destroyed. During this time the tree can also become more susceptible to other pests and diseases which reduces the viability of the tree further (NatureServe 2018). The pest was thought to be introduced at the end of the 1960's and has since caused the global population of butternut to decline. Currently methods of mitigation are not fully understood. The population now exists in smaller numbers, than across the last century.<br/><br/>Parks <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013 also notes that the species is threatened by historical habitat loss, poor regeneration and genetic dilution caused by hybridisation with <em>Juglans ailantifolia</em>. Potter <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017 also identified that the species may be 'vulnerable' to climate change but with some capacity to adapt.","The species is 'scattered' or 'sporadic' in its habitats but may occasionally form small pure groups (Broders <em>et al. </em>2015). &#160;Small isolated pockets are found in the south of the range, and subpopulations in Wisconsin, Michingan, Ontario and Quebec are considered disjunct (Coladonato 1991). The species is rarely dominant, but in some sites is co-dominant with an overall low abundance (Michler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>Population is subject to a high rate of decline. This is a consequence of infection of trees by the fungus <em>Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum</em>, commonly known as butternut canker (Broders&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, NatureServe 2018). This fungal pest was first reported in 1967 and the population of butternut has continued to decline since its invasion. In some states up to 91% of trees can be infected, putting them at risk of death (McIlwrick&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000). Seven midwestern states recorded a decline in butternut trees of 23% (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006) while Wisconsin recorded a loss of between 27 and 92% by 1992 (Michler <em>et al. </em>2006). Flickinger (2015) reports a decrease in number of butternut trees from 1.4 million individuals to 84,000 individuals, a 94% decline. In general, the average loss across reporting states is around 80% (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000). The species is also subject to decline in its Canadian range at a similar rate.<br/><br/>Despite this decline the species is still present in habitat as infected individuals, uninfected saplings, mature putative resistant trees (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000). The species currently maintains good genetic diversity and there is some natural resistance to&#160;<em>O. clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>(Ross-Davis <em>et al. </em>2008). Other causes of population decline are due to habitat loss, poor regeneration and genetic dilution (Parks <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>The species produces seed from 20 to 60 years old, hence generation length is given as 40 years. Therefore, across three generations looking from 1967 to 2067 it is estimated that the population will experience decline between 50 and 80%. There has been a historical reduction of up to 80% based on the loss of trees due to butternut canker, and the variable rate this has occurred across the range. There is a high rate of infection and high rate of mortality of the tree. Decline will continue into the future as&#160;<em>O. clavigignenti-juglandacearum </em>is present across the entire species range and there is no known remedy (Parks <em>et al. </em>2013). Decline over the next 100 years could also be as much as 80%, considering a conservative estimate.",Decreasing,"This species is native to North America where it is present in much of eastern Canada and eastern United States. Here it occurs from new Brunswick, south to Georgia and Alabama, across to Missouri and north to Wisconsin. It is present in 29 US states (NatureServe 2018). The species occurs at low elevations up to 4,900 ft.","Butternut is a valued lumber and timber species (NatureServe 2018). The wood can be used to make cabinets, furniture and novelties (Burns &amp; Honkala<em>&#160;</em>1990). The nut of the tree can also be harvested and eaten by humans. The bark, roots and husks can be utilised for medicinal purposes (Ross-Davis <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).",Terrestrial,"The species is assessed as Endangered for Canada (COSEWIC 2008). US NatureServe tracks that the species is at risk in many states, but at the national level is assessed as G4 ('Apparently secure'), as the species 'is not currently vulnerable to extinction' as large numbers still persist across the species range. The species is present on the US Endangered Species Act (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000). There was also a moratorium placed on the trade of this species from Minnesota (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000) and in general, the harvest of this species for timber is now more restricted to ensure that healthy, uninfected individuals persist in the wild.&#160;<br/><br/>There is currently no effective or practical management techniques known that completely protect <em>Juglans cinerea </em>from butternut canker. Various research is occurring to investigate remedies to butternut canker infection. This includes looking at <em>in vitro </em>propagation, breeding resistance, use of fungicides and pesticides, reducing timber harvest and developing <em>ex situ </em>conservation stands, DNA and seed banks (McIlwrick <em>et al. </em>2000, NatureServe 2018). Remaining stands of the tree need to be managed to encourage regeneration, such as reducing canopy to better establishment of butternut (Parks <em>et al. </em>2013). There needs to be continuing monitoring of the population for decline and regeneration. The species is present in at least 137 <em>ex situ </em>collections.",Nearctic,,,,Global,407,56,13.75921376,13.87066774,100,42.54329383,HP

It is found scattered in open canopy forests, and on water collecting sites such as streambanks, upper breaches, shoreline thickets, estuary fringes, swamps and open canyons from 0 to 1,420 m asl (at an average elevation of 121 m asl, with occurrence decreasing with increasing elevation)&#160;(Klinkenberg 2013,&#160;Giblin 2014). It is documented to be common in sites with ocean spray, such as on coastal islands and adjacent mainland, and is characteristic of nutrient-rich wetlands (Klinkenberg 2013). In Alaska this species occurs in calcareous Karst fens which are documented to be rare due to the limited presence of limestone geology (Alaska Natural Heritage Program 2014).","There are no current known threats to this species (Devine <em>et al. </em>2012), however Karst fen habitat in southern Alaska has been designated of conservation concern and so it should be determined whether this species is directly or indirectly affected by the threats facing this habitat (Alaska Natural Heritage Program 2014). Threats to Karst fens in this region include: increased runoff from intensive timber harvest, surface disturbance, conversion of land to grazing, agriculture, invasive species (increased by close proximity to roads) and activities that influence water chemistry or hydrology (Alaska Natural Heritage Program 2014). Climate change is also suspected to have an impact on this species' habitat but more research is required to validate this.","The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture states that this species is abundant and of no conservation concern (Giblin 2014). It has also been assessed as 'Yellow' (apparently secure and not at risk of extinction) in the Canadian Province of British Columbia (B.C. Conservation Data Centre 2014).

It is also considered important habitat for Texas' native bees (The Xerces Society 2013).","The Edwards Plateau where Peachbush occurs is threatened by development due to the rapid growth of the urban settlements of San Antonio, San Marcos, Austin, Round  Rock, and the suburbanizing areas around them. Further west, many formerly rural  areas have become retirement communities or vacation resorts. Outside the urban  areas large ranches are being replaced by âranchettesâ of 1â20 acres. As Texas is predominantly privately owned, most land is not protected from development. Fire, as a land management strategy, is used less and less as housing  density increases. The increasing population causes more use of recreational areas, which tends  to degrade the quality of the habitat for conservation. Invasive species are also a likely threat from resident's gardens (Fowler 2013).

Its adaptability might be one of the main reasons to be such a serious weed in some areas (Global Invasive Species Database 2018), as well as its allelopathy (Chapla and Campos 2010). It is pollinated mainly by honeybees and is dispersed by birds, monkeys, rats, feral pigs (Global Invasive Species Database 2018), bats and there is even a record of its fruits being eaten by opossums (Pizo 2000).","There are no documented major threats for this species. Although there  are high deforestation rates in parts of its native distribution range,  this species thrives in disturbed areas and might actually benefit from  deforestation.","Although this species is very abundant considering its wide range and the number of specimens collected in the wild and from native countries held in different herbaria, the overall population size and trend are unknown.",Unknown,"This species probably originated in Mexico and is native from Central and western South America, from Mexico to Argentina. However, its exact native range is uncertain as it has been introduced in most tropical and subtropical countries for its edible fruits (Landrum 2017), including in Southeast Asia, Australia, central and southern Africa and eastern South America (WCSP 2018). It has become naturalised in many of these countries and it has been listed as invasive in other regions, such as Hawaii, Galapagos, southern Africa, New Zealand (Cronk and Fuller 2001) and many other pacific islands (Global Invasive Species Database 2018). Its extent of occurrence (EOO), based on its native distribution, has been calculated as more than 15,000,000 km<sup>2</sup> and its area of occupancy (AOO) is much larger than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>.","This species is one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit trees widely cultivated for its edible fruits, rich in vitamin C and eaten raw or processed into jams and preserves, beverages and ice creams (Berry <em>et al. </em>2003). It is also used medicinally for various purposes such as gastroenteritis, dysentery, stomach (GutiÃ©rrez <em>et al.</em> 2008) and dental infections (Agbor and Naidoo 2015). Researched has showed that its leaves have antioxidant, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-bacterial properties (GutiÃ©rrez <em>et al.</em> 2008). Its wood is also used in carpentry, construction and manufacture of toys and accessories (GutiÃ©rrez <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Terrestrial,,Nearctic|Neotropical,,,,Global,313,0,0,16.05380585,94.11764706,36.72381764,HP

According to available occurrence records its elevation ranges from 1 m asl, for example in South Africa (herbarium specimen Strey 7329) to 3,439 m asl in Argentina (catalogue number 2874676 from Genesys Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources 2019).","Reported to be palatable to cattle and elephants on some herbarium specimens from Zambia (Burkill 1995). It is a crop wild relative so has potential use as a gene donor to its related crops, Bambara Groundnut and Cowpea.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The genus <em>Vigna</em> is listed in Annex I of the International     Treaty  on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture as part  of    the  Cowpea gene pool (FAO 2009). <em>Vigna luteola</em> is assessed as Near Threatened (NT) in Burkina Faso (which is outside the species' native range) (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2017), as Least Concern (LC) in Puerto Rico (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Taiwan (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2012), and as Not Threatened (G5) in the US (NatureServe 2017). There are 176  germplasm accessions of wild origin reported by Genesys of which 123 are  backed up at a second genebank, including 73 in the Svalbard Seed  Vault. Out of the 176 accessions, 137 were collected within the species'  native range (19 in Brazil, 18 in Argentina, 17 in Colombia, 16 in  Kenya, 14 in Botswana, eight in Belize, five in Cuba, four in Guyana,  Tanzania, the US and Venezuela, three in Australia, Ecuador, Israel,  Mexico, Peru and Rwanda, two in Antigua and Barbuda, Cameroon and  Honduras). A further 39 from undisclosed country of origin (Genesys  Global Portal on Plant Genetic Resources 2019). Maxted <em>et al. </em>(2004)  recommends further collection in north-eastern Africa and southern  Africa. In addition, the authors highlights that the fact that it is  eaten by cattle and elephants justifies more systematic <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> collection. By  overlaying the species' occurrence data with the existing network of  protected areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019), several occurrences occur within various protected areas throughout the species range (e.g. Freshwater Creek Forest Reserve in Belize, Antisana Reserva EcolÃ³gica in Ecuador, Atlantic Forest Southeast Reserve in Brazil, Okavango Delta System Ramsar Site in Botswana, Parc Nacional des Virunga in the Democratic Republic of&#160; Congo, Iriomote ishigaki National Park in Japan, Blackbraes National Park in Australia). The presence of the  species within these areas requires field confirmation but if it does  occur, it is unlikely to be actively conserved as it is  not monitored. Nevertheless, a management plan could probably be  designed to actively protect the species in these areas. Maxted <em>et al. </em>(2004)  recommends that subpopulations in areas that are flooded seasonally or overgrazed should be monitored.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Neotropical,,,,Global,192,31,16.14583333,23.50659567,70.58823529,36.7468881,HP
